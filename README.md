# Snoqualmie
The project Snoqualmie aims to create a composable and decentralized social graph protocol on Flow. Critical social graph components are represented using NFTs.

# Motivation
Flow blockchain lacks a flexible and scalable social graph protocol. Once built, the Snoqualmie Protocol will be able to provide a scalable infrastructure on Flow to allow different dApp builders to utilize its social platform related features to build customized and optimized user experience.

Similar to Lens Protocol on Polygon, the Snoqualmie Protocol aims to build a user-owned, open social graph that any dApps can plug into. For users, Snoqualmie Protocol opens the opportunity to have truely user owned content and user data by incorporating NFTs into its building blocks.

In the long-term, we would like to set up a DAO on Flow to orchastrate and supervise the design, development and moderation of the Snoqualmie Protocol. We are also interested in exploring different monetization opportunities within the Snoqualmie Protocol's ecosystem.

Note: we just started the project and don't have time to finish its all components. Work will be continued and we would like to make Snoqualmie Protocol a long-term project.
